### FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

Breach of Written Contract Against All Defendants
-------------------------------------------------

Plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein by reference each and every allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 9 above as set forth in full.

Between in or about June 2022 and August 2022, Defendants and Plaintiff entered into written contracts for the production, packaging, and sale to and for the benefit of Defendants of various vodka products, and the procurement of related labels (the “Written Contracts”). True and correct copies of documents that, without limitation to other and further proof, comprise or otherwise represent or reflect, the Written Contracts, which include, but are not limited to, that certain Production Agreement dated June 2, 2022 (the “Production Agreement”), purchase orders, and related invoices, are attached hereto, collectively, as Exhibit 1 and incorporated herein by this reference.

During this time, pursuant to the Written Contracts, Plaintiff produced, packaged, sold, shipped, and delivered to Defendants such vodka products, and in connection therewith procured necessary labels, for no less than 4,730 cases of 750 ml commercial standard round glass bottles containing vodka (collectively, the “Vodka Products”) and associated labels for Defendants’ then-current production run, as well as a then-contemplated future 35,000-case production run (collectively, the “Production Runs”). Plaintiff purchased labels for the Production Runs from a third party labeling company (collectively, the “Labels,” and together with the Vodka Products, the “Goods”), performed all the other services and actions described herein, for the benefit of and at Defendants’ request, and based on Defendants’ specifications. As a result, Defendants became indebted to Plaintiff in the principal amount of no less than $320,384.15, less a recent $1,000 token payment (the “Principal Debt”), comprised of the principal sum of $239,449.15 for the Vodka Products and $80,935.00 for the cost and lost profits for the Labels.

Plaintiff is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that it performed all conditions, covenants, and promises under the Written Contracts it was required to perform thereunder, and otherwise complied with the Written Contracts in all respects, and produced, packaged, procured, sold, shipped, and delivered to Defendants all Goods needed to be shipped and delivered, in full accordance and compliance with all requests and specifications of Defendants. Plaintiff made demand for payment for the Goods and related services.

The Principal Debt, less the recent $1,000 token payment, is and remains immediately due and payable in full. Despite Plaintiff’s repeated demands for payment, as well as Defendants’ repeated promises, representations, and assurances that payment was forthcoming, other than a $1,000 token payment, Defendants have failed and refused, and continue to fail and refuse, to make any payment to Plaintiff on account of the Principal Debt.

On or about December 13, 2022, Plaintiff made further written demand of Defendants for payment of the Principal Debt (together with interest at the legal rate). A true and correct copy of Plaintiff’s December 13, 2022, demand letter to Defendants is attached hereto as Exhibit 2 and incorporated herein by this reference. Defendants failed to contest the Principal Debt, or any portion thereof, and, in acknowledging and conceding such debt, promised, represented, and assured that payment in full was forthcoming and would be made to Plaintiff no later than on or about December 26, 2022 (although the Principal Debt already was over 90 days overdue).

Notwithstanding the foregoing demands, concessions, promises, representations, and assurances of payment, other than a $1,000 token payment, Defendants have failed and refused, and continue to fail and refuse, to pay the Principal Debt, or any portion thereof. Defendants’ failure and refusal to pay the Principal Debt constitutes a breach of the Written Contracts.

As a result of Defendants’ breach of the Written Contracts, Plaintiff has been forced to retain counsel and to incur, and continues to incur, attorneys’ fees and costs to recover payment of the Principal Debt and to otherwise enforce the Production Agreement and other agreements that comprise the Written Contracts. Paragraph 14.12 of the Production Agreement states, in part, that if action is instituted to enforce the terms of that agreement, the prevailing party is entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and costs.

As a result of Defendants’ breach of the Written Contracts, Plaintiff has been damaged in the amount of no less than the Principal Debt, less the $1,000 token payment, plus additional interest, late charges, costs, attorneys’ fees and expenses, and other damages according to proof, and there is now due, owing, and unpaid from Defendants to Plaintiff the sum equal to no less than the Principal Debt, plus additional interest, late charges, costs, attorneys’ fees and expenses, and other damages according to proof.

### SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

Breach of Oral Contract Against All Defendants
----------------------------------------------

Plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein by reference each and every allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 9 above as set forth in full.

Between in or about June 2022 and August 2022, Defendants and Plaintiff entered into oral contracts for the production, packaging, and sale to, and for the benefit of, Defendants of various vodka products, and the procurement of related labels (the “Oral Contracts”).

During this time, pursuant to the Oral Contracts, Plaintiff produced, packaged, sold, shipped, and delivered to Defendants the Vodka Products and procured the necessary Labels for Defendants, all at Defendants’ requests and based on Defendants’ specifications. As a result, Defendants became indebted to Plaintiff in the principal amount of no less than $320,384.15, less a recent $1,000 token payment, comprised of the principal sum of $239,449.15 for the Vodka Products and $80,935.00 for the cost and lost profits for the Labels.

Plaintiff is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that it performed all conditions, covenants, and promises under the Oral Contracts it was required perform thereunder, and otherwise complied with the Oral Contracts in all respects, and produced, packaged, procured, sold, shipped, and delivered to Defendants all Goods that need to be shipped and delivered in full accordance and compliance with all requests and specifications of Defendants. Plaintiff made demand for payment for the Goods and related services.

The Principal Debt, less the recent $1,000 token payment, is and remains immediately due and payable in full. Despite Plaintiff’s repeated demands for payment, as well as Defendants’ repeated promises, representations, and assurances that payment was forthcoming, other than a $1,000 token payment, Defendants have failed and refused, and continue to fail and refuse, to make any payment to Plaintiff on account of the Principal Debt.

On or about December 13, 2022, Plaintiff made further written demand of Defendants for payment of the Principal Debt (together with interest at the legal rate). A true and correct copy of Plaintiff’s December 13, 2022, demand letter to Defendants is attached hereto as Exhibit 2 and incorporated herein by this reference. Defendants failed to contest the Principal Debt, or any portion thereof, and, in acknowledging and conceding such debt, promised, represented, and assured that payment in full was forthcoming and would be made to Plaintiff no later than on or about December 26, 2022 (although the Principal Debt already was over 90 days overdue).

Notwithstanding the foregoing demands, concessions, promises, representations, and assurances of payment, other than a $1,000 token payment, Defendants have failed and refused, and continue to fail and refuse, to pay the Principal Debt, or any portion thereof. Defendants’ failure and refusal to pay the Principal Debt constitutes a breach of the Oral Contracts.

As a result of Defendants’ breach of the Oral Contracts, Plaintiff has been forced to retain counsel and to incur, and continues to incur, attorneys’ fees and costs to recover payment of the Principal Debt and to otherwise enforce the Oral Contracts.

As a result of Defendants’ breach of the Oral Contracts, Plaintiff has been damaged in the amount of no less than the Principal Debt, plus additional interest, late charges, costs, attorneys’ fees and expenses, and other damages according to proof, and there is now due, owing, and unpaid from Defendants to Plaintiff the sum equal to no less than the Principal Debt, less the $1,000 token payment plus additional interest, late charges, costs, attorneys’ fees and expenses, and other damages according to proof.

True and correct copies of documents that, without limitation to other and further proof, comprise or otherwise represent or reflect, the sale and delivery of Goods to Defendants and the Principal Debt, or any portion thereof, are attached hereto, collectively, as Exhibit 1 and incorporated herein by this reference.

The Principal Debt, less a recent $1,000 token payment, is and remains immediately due and payable in full. Despite Plaintiff’s repeated demands for payment, as well as Defendants’ repeated promises, representations, and assurances that payment was forthcoming, other than a $1,000 token payment, Defendants have failed and refused, and continue to fail and refuse, to make any payment to Plaintiff on account of the Principal Debt.

On or about December 13, 2022, Plaintiff made further written demand of Defendants for payment of the Principal Debt (together with interest at the legal rate). A true and correct copy of Plaintiff’s December 13, 2022, demand letter to Defendants is attached hereto as Exhibit 2 and incorporated herein by this reference. Defendants failed to contest the Principal Debt, or any portion thereof, and, in acknowledging and conceding such debt, promised, represented, and assured that payment in full was forthcoming and would be made to Plaintiff no later than on or about December 26, 2022 (although the Principal Debt already was over 90 days overdue).

Notwithstanding the foregoing demands, concessions, promises, representations, and assurances of payment, other than a $1,000 token payment, Defendants have failed and refused, and continue to fail and refuse, to pay the Principal Debt, or any portion thereof.

As a result of Defendants’ failure and refusal to pay the Principal Debt, Plaintiff has been forced to retain counsel and to incur, and continues to incur, attorneys’ fees and costs to recover payment of the Principal Debt.

### FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

-------------------------------------

Plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein by reference each and every allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 34 above as set forth in full.

Between in or about June 2022 and August 2022, an account was stated, in writing, by and between Plaintiff and Defendants, wherein it was agreed that Defendants would be indebted to Plaintiff in the sum of no less than the Principal Debt (the “Account Stated”).

Without limitation to other and further proof, attached hereto, collectively, as Exhibit 1, and incorporated herein by this reference, are true and correct copies of documents evidencing the Principal Debt, or any portion thereof, and the Account Stated.

The Principal Debt on the Account Stated, less a recent $1,000 token payment, is and remains immediately due and payable in full. Despite Plaintiff’s repeated demands for payment, as well as Defendants’ repeated promises, representations, and assurances that payment was forthcoming, other than a $1,000 token payment, Defendants have failed and refused, and continue to fail and refuse, to make any payment of the Principal Debt to Plaintiff on such Account Stated.

A true and correct copy of Plaintiff’s December 13, 2022, demand letter to Defendants is attached hereto as Exhibit 2 and incorporated herein by this reference.

### SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

Quantum Meruit Against All Defendants
-------------------------------------

Plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein by reference each and every allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 58 above as set forth in full.

As set forth above, Plaintiff has performed valuable services, provided valuable goods, and incurred considerable expenses for the benefit, and at the specific request (directly and/or indirectly), of Defendants, and each of them, who received considerable value and benefit therefrom, including without limitation to other and further proof, the value added to their business or businesses.

Without limitation to other and further proof, attached hereto, collectively, as Exhibit 1, and incorporated herein by this reference, are true and correct copies of documents establishing and evidencing the reasonable value of such services and goods, or any portion thereof.

Defendants have yet to fully compensate Plaintiff for such valuable services and goods, and based thereon it would be inequitable for Defendants to retain the stated benefit, and enjoy the stated value, without providing just payment to Plaintiff for such valuable services and goods.

As a direct and proximate result of the acts of Defendants as set forth above, Plaintiff has been damaged in the amount of no less than the Principal Debt, less the recent $1,000 token payment, plus additional interest, late charges, costs, attorneys’ fees and expenses, and other damages according to proof.

### EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION

Promise Without Intent to Perform Against All Defendants
--------------------------------------------------------

Plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein by reference each and every allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 63 above as set forth in full.

Between in or about June 2022 and August 2022, Defendants requested and authorized Plaintiff to perform valuable services, provide valuable goods, and incur considerable expenses for the benefit, and at the specific request (directly and/or indirectly), of Defendants, and each of them, who received considerable value and benefit therefrom, and, thereby promised to pay Plaintiff for the Goods in the sum of no less than the Principal Debt.

Without limitation to other and further proof, attached hereto, collectively, as Exhibit 1, and incorporated herein by this reference, are true and correct copies of documents establishing and evidencing that valuable goods and services were provided, and that such requests and promises were made.

Defendants’ promises to pay for the Goods were material to Plaintiff’s decision to actually produce, package, procure, sell, ship, and deliver the Goods, and to otherwise perform at Defendants’ requests.

Plaintiff is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that Defendants were fully aware that their promises were material to Plaintiff’s decision to perform and continue to perform as set forth above. Plaintiff is further informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that Defendants’ promises were made with intent to defraud and induce Plaintiff to perform and continue to perform as set forth above. At the time Plaintiff performed upon such promises, Plaintiff was unaware, and could not reasonably have been aware, of Defendants’ intent not to pay based on such promises. Plaintiff acted in justifiable reliance upon such promises.

The Principal Debt, less a recent $1,000 token payment, is and remains immediately due and payable in full. Because of Plaintiff’s justifiable reliance on Defendants’ conduct, Plaintiff has been damaged in the amount of no less than the Principal Debt, plus additional interest, late charges, costs, attorneys’ fees and expenses, and other damages according to proof, and there is now due, owing, and unpaid from Defendants to Plaintiff the sum equal to no less than the Principal Debt, less the $1,000 token payment, plus additional interest, late charges, costs, attorneys’ fees and expenses, and other damages according to proof.

The token $1,000 payment made by Defendants in December 2022 was not a partial payment on the Principal Debt, but was instead part of Defendants’ scheme to delay and **defraud Plaintiff** with the design to postpone action by Plaintiff to collect the Principal Debt.

Plaintiff is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the actions alleged above were done with malice, oppression, and/or willful disregard for the rights of Plaintiff, were fraudulent, and were undertaken by Defendants with an intent to injure Plaintiff, and for Defendants’ personal gain, and that such actions constitute despicable conduct that entitles Plaintiff to punitive and exemplary damages in the sum to be set by the Court.
